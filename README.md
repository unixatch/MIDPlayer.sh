# MIDPlayer.sh

This bash script plays midi files with their appropriate soundfonts in a more automated way since i couldn't find any better alternative, i made one.

## Requirements

You'll need:
- timidity++;
- mpv;
- ffmpeg;
in order to run this script and be executable, you can do that with:

```bash
chmod +x midiplayer.sh
```

inside the same directory where the script is.

There are multiple options if you need to tweak it and you can use a config.cfg file so you can change each midi.

See [COMMAND-LINE-OPTIONS](COMMAND-LINE-OPTIONS.md) and [CONFIG-OPTIONS](CONFIG-OPTIONS.md) for more informations.
